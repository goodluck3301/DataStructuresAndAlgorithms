There are several ways to implement a map in Kotlin, each with its own advantages and use cases. Some of the most common implementations include:

1) HashMap: This is the default implementation of a map in Kotlin and is based on a hash table. It provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (get and put). Example:

```kt
val map = HashMap<String, Int>()
map["key1"] = 1
map["key2"] = 2
println(map["key1"]) // prints 1
```

2) LinkedHashMap: This is similar to the HashMap, but it also maintains the insertion order of the elements. This can be useful if you need to iterate through the elements in the order they were added. Example:

```kt
val map = LinkedHashMap<String, Int>()
map["key1"] = 1
map["key2"] = 2
for ((key, value) in map) {
    println("$key: $value")
}
```

3) TreeMap: This implementation is based on a red-black tree, which keeps the elements in sorted order according to their natural ordering or a custom comparator. 
 Example:
 ```kt
 val map = TreeMap<String, Int>()
map["key1"] = 1
map["key2"] = 2
for ((key, value) in map) {
    println("$key: $value")
}
```

4) EnumMap: This is a specialized map implementation for keys that are enum types. It provides better performance than a general-purpose map because it can use the enum's ordinal value as the key's hash code. 
Example:

```kt
enum class MyEnum {
    VALUE1, VALUE2
}

val map = EnumMap<MyEnum, Int>(MyEnum::class.java)
map[MyEnum.VALUE1] = 1
map[MyEnum.VALUE2] = 2
println(map[MyEnum.VALUE1]) // prints 1
```

5) ConcurrentHashMap: This is a thread-safe implementation of a map, suitable for use in a multi-threaded environment. 
Example:

```kt
val map = ConcurrentHashMap<String, Int>()
val thread1 = Thread { map["key1"] = 1 }
val thread2 = Thread { map["key2"] = 2 }
thread1.start()
thread2.start()
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
println(map["key1"]) // prints 1
```
